## What Had I learned From Learn-A-Bit Challenge #4

This is the fourth challenge that I participated for the learn-a-bit challenge series. After I improved my understanding in semantic, mobile first approach and media query, it took me half of the time to complete this challenge than any previous challenges. I comfortably use my flex knowledge to position elements on the page. I suspect there will be a better way of solving media query issue with less code but mine works perfectly for now. I look forward to get feedback from my mentors to continue improving my CSS skills. I have confidence that I will continue making progress in the next challenge.
